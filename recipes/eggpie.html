      <h4>What is it?</h4>
      <p>
        Egg Pie is a sweet Filipino dessert that resembles an egg custard.
        Though famous in the Philippines and can be seen even in local bakeries,
        this delicious dessert has not made its own identity yet and is often
        confused as a giant egg custard or something else. Well, now is the
        right time to show-off some of our countryâ€™s sweet indulgence.
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <h4>Pie crust</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter chilled and cut into cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 to 1/2 cup cold water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Filling</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 cups evaporated milk</li>
        <li>3 pieces raw eggs</li>
        <li>1 piece egg white separated from the yolk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create the crust by combining the flour, sugar, and salt then mix
          well.
        </li>
        <li>Add the butter in the middle and mix using a pastry mixer.</li>
        <li>
          Gradually pour the cold water while mixing the ingredients. Continue
          mixing until all the ingredients are well incorporated.
        </li>
        <li>Gather the dough and mold it into a ball-shaped figure.</li>
        <li>
          Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes to harden the butter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprinkle flour on a clean flat surface and flatten the refrigerated
          dough using a rolling pin. The flattened dough should be wide enough
          to cover a 9 inch circular baking pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arrange the flattened dough on top of the baking pan and cut the extra
          edge using a pair of scissors.
        </li>
        <li>Refrigerate while doing the filling.</li>
        <li>
          Start making the filling by scalding the evaporated milk. This is done
          by heating it in the microwave oven for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large mixing bowl, combine the 3 raw eggs and the separated egg

          properly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>Pour-in the scalded milk then mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>
          Beat the separated egg white using an electric mixer until it forms
        </li>
        <li>Fold the processed egg white in the milk-eggs-sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling mixture on the refrigerated pie crust.</li>
        <li>
          Bake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit then lower the heat to
          325 degrees Fahrenheit and continue baking for 30 to 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the egg pie from the oven and let cool.</li>
        <li>Serve for dessert. Share and enjoy!</li>
