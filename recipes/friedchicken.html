      <h4>What is it?</h4>
      <p>
        This crispy fried chicken recipe uses a batter instead of a flour
        coating. That helps the flour adhere to the chicken so it won’t fall off
        after cooking!
      </p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons pepper, divided</li>
        <li>2-1/2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 broiler/fryer chickens (3-1/2 to 4 pounds each), cut up</li>
        <li>Oil for deep-fat frying</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large shallow dish, combine 2-2/3 cups flour, garlic salt,
          paprika, 2-1/2 teaspoons pepper and poultry seasoning. In another
          shallow dish, beat eggs and 1-1/2 cups water; add salt and the
          remaining 1-1/3 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Dip chicken in egg
          mixture, then place in flour mixture, a few pieces at a time. Turn to
          coat.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375°. Fry chicken, several pieces at
          a time, until chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, 7-8
          minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels.
